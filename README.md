##Directory Structures
- `Development Environment` : The files or programs possibly necessary for 
    setting up the development environment.
    - `Drivers` : The drivers for devices used during the development 
        procedure.
    - `IDE` : The integrated development environment provided for the 
        development, such as the Arduino IDE.
    - `Miniquad Controller` : The controller to configurate or control the 
        Miniquad(C) robot.
- `Project Documents`: The documents of Miniquad(C) project, which provides 
    information about project schedule, development details, and so on.
